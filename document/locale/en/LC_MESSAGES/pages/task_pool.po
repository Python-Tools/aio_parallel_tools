"We use task pool to limit the parallelism of asynchronous tasks. "
"Generally, asynchronous io tasks is easy to hit a bottleneck of server. "
"And connection pool usualy can only tell you that connection pool is "
"full. So we need a task pool to limit the parallelism of asynchronous "
"tasks so that server's io limit will not so easy to reach."
